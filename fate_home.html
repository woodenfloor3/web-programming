        <h1> Fate/StayNight </h1>

        <br>

        <p>In 2004, TYPE-MOON made their commercial debut with an PC visual novel called Fate/stay night. It was the origin of the Fate series. For those who don’t know, a visual novel is a computer game consisting of text that is read on the screen. The ‘visual’ aspect is that images of the characters and the background also appear on-screen, and there are additions such as background music, sound effects, and sometimes even voice acting! Many visual novels allow you to make certain choices in-game, and the game may progress differently depending on the player’s choices. Fate/stay night has three main routes that you can follow depending on your choices, with each of them focusing on a different heroine. The three main routes of the original Fate/stay night game are as follows:
		<ul>
			<li>The Fate Route, which focuses on Saber (this was adapted into the 2006 TV anime Fate/stay night)</li>
			<li>The Unlimited Blade Works Route, which focuses on Rin Tohsaka (This was adapted into the 2010 anime movie Fate/stay Night Unlimited Blade Works by Studio Deen and then was adapted again into a TV anime and OVA by studio ufotable in 2014-2015 )</li>
			<li>The Heaven’s Feel Route, which focuses on Sakura Matou (this is currently being adapted into a movie trilogy by ufotable, with the first movie due to be released in October 2017)</li>
		</ul>
In 2005, a sequel game called Fate/hollow ataraxia was released, titled Fate/stay night: Réalta Nua, was also released. Many spin-offs, novels, manga, anime and more set in alternate timelines and universes have since been released as part of the Fate series. </p>
